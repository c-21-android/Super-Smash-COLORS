# The idea

I'm thinking of making a game like smash bros where the fighters are of different colors.
However the color scheming is not just for cosmetics. The goal is that depending on the color
you inherit moves from major color families to varying percentages. Each fighter can be refered
by its color hexadecimal code. 

You can have your unique main by picking a hexadecimal color code
that no one has taken yet. You go from game to game by just inserting the hexadecimal code when
selecting your character.

You can think of it as a randomly generated fighting game. The possibility of having this many
characters is to offer great variety.

The goal is to make a local multiplayer game out of this. I don't have dev abilities to make it
online but it could be expanded later on.

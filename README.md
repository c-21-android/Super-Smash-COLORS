2D Fighting game like super smash bros but each color in the color wheel is a fighter.

# The idea

I'm thinking of making a game like smash bros where the fighters are of different colors.
However the color scheming is not just for cosmetics. The goal is that depending on the color
you inherit moves from major color families to varying percentages. Each fighter can be refered
by its color hexadecimal code. 

You can have your unique main by picking a hexadecimal color code
that no one has taken yet. You go from game to game by just inserting the hexadecimal code when
selecting your character.

You can think of it as a randomly generated fighting game. The possibility of having this many
characters is to offer great variety.

The goal is to make a local multiplayer game out of this. I don't have dev abilities to make it
online but it could be expanded later on.


# Road Map
- Decides which moves to give to each main color families (Decide which colors are main families (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, etc...)).
- Decides which moves are likely to be inherited by the fighter depending on the percentages of colors.
- Implement the moves themselves (The animation).
- Make one stage.
- Allow for 4 players (this mean implementing game pad support is essential).
- Give the player the ability to insert a hexadecimal code to select his main.

# I intend the first version of this game to be web based. I know that people are rarely willing to download stuff.

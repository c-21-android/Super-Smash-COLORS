# Super-Smash-COLORS
2D Fighting game like super smash bros but each color in the color wheel is a fighter.

# The idea
I'm thinking of making a game like smash bros where the fighters are of different colors.
However the color scheming is not just for cosmetics. The goal is that depending on the color
you inherit moves from major color families to varying percentages. Each fighter can be refered
by its color hexadecimal code.
